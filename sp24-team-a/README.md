Hi!

We are Team A working on a project for the city of Boston trying to understand remodeling and unit loss within the city. We were tasked with understanding where unit loss was happening and trying to understand the trends with unit loss within different neighborhoods of Boston. Within this Github Repo, you will find our teams work as we developed reports and analysis over the first few months of 2024. 

We were given two datasets which you will find under the data folder. Because the files were too large to add directly, we have added links within a text file that you can navigate to. Once those are downloaded, you can use them within the analysis files. 

We have also organized our notebooks of analysis with the analysis folder where you can check each individual team members analysis into the project. The analysis is structured in jupyter notebooks which should all run out of the box given you have basic data science packages included in something like anaconda.

We were presented with 4 main questions:

  1. What communities are building more housing units? 
  2. Which ones are losing housing units? 
  3. Where are housing remodels and renovations happening? 
  4. How many housing units are lost to remodels on average, each year?

These questions were answered over the last few months through an early insights report/presentation and our midsemester presentation.

Analysis of these base questions brought up new ideas and helped fuel 3 extension questions which we presented and outlined within our final presentation: 

  1. How does the rate of renovations in each community influence the annual variation in housing availability?
  2. The factors that lead to substantial shifts in housing availability in areas like Hyde Park and the South End.
  3. Which communities have the most significant reductions in housing units due to conversions of Multi-unit properties into Single-family homes by higher-income residents?


You can find our groupsâ€™ slide decks from our various presentations in the presentations folder, and the reports in the reports folder. If you would like to read about our findings read our Final Report in the reports folder. We hope you gain some insights from our research!
