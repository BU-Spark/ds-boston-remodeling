# Project Name: City of Boston: Remodeling and Unit Loss Team C

## Overview
This repository contains the work of our team as we progressed through different stages of our project. The aim of this project was the analyze Boston housing data over a period of around 20 years to see if the City of Boston was losing units due to remodelling. On top of that we took a look at which areas were most affected by renovations, which areas recieved the most spending and various other things related to the topic.

## Repository Structure

### `/data/`
Contains a document with links to all datasets used in the project, along with instructions on where to place the data for respective files. 

### `/Early Insights Notebooks/`
Includes preliminary analysis notebooks for our early insights, with each notebook authored by different team members.

- **Presentation:** Related insights are presented in the `Presentations/` folder.

### `/Mid Semester Notebooks/`
Contains analysis notebooks prepared for the mid-semester review. Each notebook is personalized with the team member's name who conducted the analysis.

- **Presentation:** Corresponding presentations can be found in `Presentations/`.

### `/Final Insights Notebooks/`
Features the concluding analysis leading up to the final presentation. Notebooks are individualized with the names of the contributors.

- **Presentation:** Final insights are encapsulated in presentations within `Presentations/`.

### `/Cleaned Bedroom Data/`
Holds the processed data which tracks properties that have experienced an increase, decrease, or no change in the number of bedrooms.

- **Data Access:** A link to these datasets is provided in the `data/` documentation.

### `/Cleaned Bedroom Merged Data/`
Holds the processed data which tracks properties that have experienced an increase, decrease, or no change in the number of bedrooms, but merged with the SAM dataset so that we have access to lat and long values for each property.

**Data Access:** A link to these datasets is provided in the `data/` documentation.

### `/Cleaned Res Units Data/`
Holds the processed data which tracks properties that have experienced an increase, decrease, or no change in the number of res units.

**Data Access:** A link to these datasets is provided in the `data/` documentation.
